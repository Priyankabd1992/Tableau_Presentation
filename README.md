Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a significant public health concern in the United States due to its widespread impact on health and mortality. Between 2009 and 2017, seasonal influenza caused considerable illness, hospitalizations, and deaths annually. The severity of flu seasons varied based on factors like the dominant virus strains, vaccine effectiveness, and population immunity. During this period, influenza-associated mortality fluctuated, with the highest death tolls occurring in seasons dominated by more virulent strains
